## Features

This tool creates a printable HTML-file containing the issues of a GitHub repository.
You can print the file, cut the cards and attach them to your physical Scrum/Kanban board.

To use it, run

```bash
# github_cards REPOSITORY_OWNER REPOSITORY_NAME
github_cards pallets click

There are some options available, e.g. to access private repositories or only select a certain milestone.

```bash
